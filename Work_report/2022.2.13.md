#### Genome-wide sequencing-based identification of methylation quantitative trait loci and their role in schizophrenia rish
>[Perzel Mandell, K.A., Eagles, N.J., Wilton, R. et al. Genome-wide sequencing-based identification of methylation quantitative loci and their role in schizophrenia risk. Nat Commun 12, 5251 (2021).](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25517-3#citeas)
#### Key notes
- Esablished a comprehensive landscape of genetic control of genomic methylation in human brain
- meQTLs are stable across tissue types(based on previous studies)
- Genetic sequence has a robust effect in local methylation levels(both CpGs and CpHs, effect in CpHs is stronger)
- Maybe genetic variants have impacts on the epigenetic plasticity of the brain

### 3 Future plan
- Read paper and try to decide the topic of review
- Collect mouse DNA methylation data and plot regression curve
  >[Comparing AV mutation and WT to figure out if there is difference in methylation age]
- For retinal organoid scRNA-seq datasets, remove ribosome genes and cell cycle associated genes. And then cluster the cells again(use Seurat).
